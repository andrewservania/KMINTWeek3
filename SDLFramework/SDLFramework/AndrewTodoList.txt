1) DONE Disable automatic respawn of rabbit on random location
2) DONE Disable automatic respawn of pill and weapon on random location when cow or rabbit has moved to the same node as one of them.
3) DONE Fix Label update. Shortest path should only be visible if when the cow is chasing the rabbit. Afterwards it should disappear.

Tasks for Sunday, 20th of September 2015
4) DONE The PILL or WEAPON should change the cow's state, NOT the COW itself. Right now, it works but it is not logical.
5) DONE When the game starts, all the game entities cow, rabbit, pill and weapon should spawn on a random location but never on the same spot as any of them.
6) DONE During runtime, if a pill, weapon or rabbit respawns, it should never respawn on the location as any of the three. Including the cow!
